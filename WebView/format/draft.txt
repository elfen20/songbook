1) Group in Blocks.
	Block are defined when first char in line is # till next line with # or end of file.
	a control char directly following the # sets the block type.
	Blocks can have a name after the control chars, separated by space.
	Defined Blocks:
	
	# Name
		generic song block. can contain chords, lyrics or both. blocks can be redefined.
		
	#! Songname
		meta info block. contains settings in key=value format.
		
	#/ Text
		Comment block. will be ignored.
	
	#+ Name
		repeat block. inserts previous defined block on this position.
		
	#_ 
		inserts a blank line or paragraph.

2) Blocks
	first line has to start with a '#'. seperated by space an optional block name to refer to later.
	
	lines starting with ' are chord lines.
	lines starting with space will have the first space stripped off.
	lines with white space will be ignored.
	all other lines are text lines.
	^ in a text line indicates a chord position which will be inserted from a previously defined block.

3) Chords
	chords can be defined in two ways: double line or inline style.
	double line style:
		first line has to start with a '
		text will be parsed as chords 
		second line has text.
	inline style:
		each line will be parsed for square brackets [] which will contain the chord(s)

4) Meta Block
	defines meta information in key=value lines.
	meta keys:
		aname:		alternative song name
		capo:		use this to hint the use of a capodaster
		trans:		transpose the chords in this song
		ref:		additional song references in books [bockname,page]
